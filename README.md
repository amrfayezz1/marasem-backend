# Marasem Backend Application

## Requirements

To set up and run the backend application, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Composer**
-   **Laravel 11+**
-   **XAMPP** (optional but recommended for this tutorial)
-   **MySQL** (optional but included in this guide)
-   **Node.js and npm**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrfayezz1/marasem-backend.git
cd marasem-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use Composer to install the PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Generate the Application Key

Run the following command to generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Create and Configure the Database

1. Start **XAMPP** and ensure MySQL is running.
2. Create a new database in MySQL for the application.
3. Update the `.env` file with your database details:
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=<your-database-name>
    DB_USERNAME=<your-database-username>
    DB_PASSWORD=<your-database-password>
    ```

### 6. Run Migrations

Execute the database migrations to set up the tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. Seed the Database

Run the seeders for each class to populate the database with initial data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=CategoriesTableSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=TagsSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=CollectionsSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=EventSeeder
```

### 8. Install Node.js Dependencies

Install the required JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 9. Compile Frontend Assets

Compile the frontend assets for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the assets are compiled, you can stop the process (Ctrl + C).

### 10. Serve the Application

Finally, serve the application:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Social Media Login

The application supports social login using the following providers:

-   **Google**
-   **Facebook**
-   **Behance (Adobe)**

**Flow:**

1. The user initiates the login by visiting the endpoint:

    ```
    GET /login/{provider}/redirect
    ```

    Replace `{provider}` with one of the supported providers (`google`, `facebook`, or `behance`).

2. The user is redirected to the selected providerâ€™s login page.

3. After successful authentication with the provider, the provider redirects the user back to:
    ```
    GET /login/{provider}/callback
    ```
    Here:
    - If the user exists in the app, they are logged in and issued a Bearer token.
    - If the user does not exist, a `404` error is returned.

**Example Requests:**

-   Redirect to Google:
    ```
    GET http://localhost:8000/login/google/redirect
    ```
-   Handle callback for Google:
    ```
    GET http://localhost:8000/login/google/callback
    ```

**Error Handling:**

-   If the social provider fails or the app cannot process the login, a `500` error is returned.
-   If no account exists for the authenticated email, a `404` error is returned.

**Token Usage:**

-   After successful login, use the Bearer token in subsequent API requests by including it in the `Authorization` header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <returned-token-here>
    ```

## Paymob Integration

This update documents the addition of Paymob payment integration to the application. It includes details on how callbacks are handled, HMAC validation, and the generation of invoices for successful transactions.

---

### 1. **Paymob Processed Callback**

This endpoint handles transaction status updates from Paymob.

**Endpoint:**

```
POST /paymob/processed-callback
```

**Purpose:**
Processes transaction data and updates the order and payment status in the database.

**Key Features:**

-   Validates HMAC for security.
-   Updates the order status to `paid` or `failed` based on transaction success.
-   Generates an invoice for successful payments.
-   Clears the user's cart upon successful payment.

---

### 2. **Paymob Response Callback**

This endpoint handles the user-facing response from Paymob after a payment attempt.

**Endpoint:**

```
GET /paymob/response-callback
```

**Purpose:**
Determines if the payment was successful or failed and redirects the user accordingly.

**Key Features:**

-   Validates HMAC for security.
-   Redirects to `payment.success` or `payment.error` routes.
-   Provides user feedback on payment status.

---

### 3. **Configuration Updates**

Ensure the following configurations are added to your `.env` file for Paymob integration:

```
PAYMOB_HMAC=your_hmac_key
PAYMOB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
PAYMOB_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
PAYMOB_INTEGRATION_ID=your_integration_id
PAYMOB_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

These values are critical for secure communication with Paymob's API.

---

### 4. **Code Additions**

#### HMAC Validation

The `validateHmac` method ensures the integrity of data received from Paymob.

#### Invoice Generation

For successful payments, invoices are generated in PDF format and stored on the server.

---

### 5. **Testing Instructions**

-   Use Postman to test the following endpoints:
    -   `POST /paymob/processed-callback`
    -   `GET /paymob/response-callback`
-   Simulate Paymob callbacks with test data and ensure proper validation and status updates.

---

This update ensures smooth integration with Paymob for seamless payment processing in the application.

## Postman Collection

To test the API, we have provided a Postman collection. Download it [here](./postman-collection.json) and import it into Postman.

## Swagger Documentation

The application also includes Swagger documentation for the API. You can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/documentation
```

## Notes

-   Ensure that **XAMPP** is running during the entire process.
-   Make sure the `.env` file is properly configured before running the application.
-   If you encounter issues, check your logs in `storage/logs` for troubleshooting.
